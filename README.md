File Integrity Checker: To create a program or script that verifies the integrity of files within a specified directory, ensuring that no files have been altered, corrupted, or tampered with.
1. Directory Scan: Traverse through the given directory and subdirectories to collect all file paths.
2. Checksum Calculation: Calculate checksums (e.g., SHA-256, MD5) for each file to create a baseline for comparison.
3. Baseline Storage: Store the calculated checksums in a secure manner for future integrity checks. This can be in a database or a simple file.
4. Integrity Check: At later points in time, recalculate the checksums of the files and compare them with the baseline to detect any changes.
5. Reporting: Generate a report detailing which files have been altered, added, or removed since the last check.
6. Alerts: Optionally, send alerts if any integrity violations are detected.
